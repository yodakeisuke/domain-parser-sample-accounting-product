## Key Guidelines

1. **Language Consistency:**
   - All instructions and code examples are in English for clarity and uniformity.

2. **Subdomain Modularity:**
   - The project is segmented by subdomains (e.g., product, order). Each subdomain contains its own models and flows.
   - Within each subdomain:
     - **Model Layer:**
       - **Command:** Contains the business logic aggregates and repositories (including in-memory implementations).
       - **Read Model:** Contains read models and query objects.
       - **Type Definitions:** Holds domain-specific type definitions.
     - **Flow Layer:**
       - Manages process logic and error handling specific to the subdomain.

3. **Common Components:**
   - Shared code, such as common types and error definitions, are stored under the `common` directory to promote reuse across subdomains.

4. **Scalability and Maintainability:**
   - The structure is designed to scale. When adding new subdomains or functionality, maintain the same layout to ensure consistency.
   - This separation of concerns simplifies code generation, testing, and maintenance.

5. **Readability for LLM Models and Agents:**
   - The clear, modular design ensures that each component's role is easily understood, facilitating automated code generation and integration.

## Usage Instructions

- **Template Adoption:** Use this directory structure as a template when starting new projects. Ensure that each new subdomain follows the established layout.
- **Code Generation:** When generating code, reference the specific sections (command, read model, flow, or common) to align with the architecture.
- **Future Expansion:** Modify and extend the structure as needed while keeping the core principles of modularity and clarity intact.
